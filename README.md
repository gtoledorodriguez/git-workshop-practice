# git-workshop-practice
Attended workshop to get practice using git. This repository holds activities done in the workshop.

Activity 1:
I have previously used git. Mostly through the github desktop. I have used commands before I but they were just given by the professors, they didn't explain anything about and with time I forgot some of the commands.
